### 树莓派最新发布硬件简介

The first Model B Raspberry Pi was originally launched for sale on the 29th February 201 2. In two short years our favourite little computer has racked up some pretty serious sales with over 3 million units sold to date and there are no signs of the rate of sale tailing off anytime soon. The Raspberry Pi is here to stay - that is now a well known fact. Both the Foundation and the community that surrounds the Raspberry Pi have produced some incredible software and hardware and has achieved some pretty amazing things - balloon flights to space, visits to Buckingham Palace and perhaps most importantly (and most relevantly to the Foundation's charitable goals) inspiring a huge number of people to get involved with computing, electronics and STEM.

第一个树莓派B最初是在2012年2月29号开始销售的。在短短两年的时间里，这个让人喜爱的小电脑已经累计了相当不错的销售量，到目前为止已经卖出超过3百万个而且短期内也没有销量下滑的迹象。树莓派发展存活了下来 - 现在这已经成为了一个众所周知的事实。树莓派官方和树莓派周边的许多社区都开发出了一些令人不可思议的软件和硬件，并已取得了一些非常了不起的成绩 - 气球的太空飞行，参观白金汉宫等等。但也许最重要的（也最接近树莓派官方的公益目标的）是它激励了很多的人参与到计算机，电子技术和STEM中来。（STEM 代表科学 Science，技术 Technology，工程 Engineering，数学 Mathematics）

As you probably already know, in the early hours (UK time) on the 14th July 2014 the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced the latest hardware upgrade - the Raspberry Pi Model B+. This represents the first major hardware change to the Raspberry Pi board since the upgrade of the Model B hardware to 512 MB of RAM in October 2012. There had been some minor changes to various components in the interim period (likely due to pricing and supply issues or similar) as well as the release of both the Camera Module, Pi NoIR and the Compute Module. Additionally, as some of the more eagle eyed of you may have noticed, more recently (around April 2014) the USB hub and LAN chip on the Model B had also been upgraded from a LAN9512 to a LAN9514 chip as well as a general redesign of the PCB. Looking at the documentation that comes in the box with the Raspberry Pi, it looks like the change may have been related to FCC class B device certification. However, the change in LAN/USB chip is likely to have also been a hardware trial of sorts before the more obvious changes were made in the Model B+, which actually make use of the additional functionality present in the upgraded LAN/USB chip.

正如你可能已经知道的，在2014年7月14日（英国时间）的早些时候树莓派官方发布了最新的硬件升级 - 树莓派 B+。这是自2012年10月将树莓派B升级为512 MB内存以后的第一次主要的硬件升级。在这中间也有过对一些组件的过渡性的小改动（可能是由于定价或者供应商之类的问题），也发布过两款摄像头模块，以及Pi NoIR 和计算模块等。此外，如果你比较细心的话可能也会注意到，最近（2014年4月左右）树莓派B的 USB hub 和 LAN 芯片也从 LAN9512 升级到了 LAN9514， 而且PCB板也被从新设计过。从树莓派包装盒里的文档来看，这些改动可能跟 FCC 对 B 类设备的认证有关。不过，对LAN/USB芯片的改动则更像是在为整个B+升级而做的准备工作，因为树莓派B+实际上已经应用了新LAN/USB芯片升级所带来的额外功能。

Where to buy?

哪里可以买到？

As per usual, the Raspberry Pi Model B+ is available to purchase from the two main distributors - RS Components and Farnell element 14 and their subsidiaries. It is also already in stock, along with a selection of accessorries, at a number of independent retailers across the world.

和往常一样，新的树莓派B+可以通过主要的两个经销商- RS Components 和 Farnell element 14 以及他们的一些子公司购买。此外，树莓派B+以及一些相关配件也已经在世界各地的零售商处开始销售。

First impressions

第一印象

Whether the Model B+ board that you purchase has originated from an RS Components or Farnell batch, the first thing you are likely to notice is the fantastic new packaging designs as can be seen on the picture on the bottom of the last page. My personal preference is the Farnell packaging, however they are both a significant improvement on the original packaging (basically a plain white box) and the product already looks far more professional with that simple step.

不管你是从 RS 还是 Element 14 购买的树莓派B+，首先可能引起会你注意的应该就是它全新的外包装设计（见上一页的附图），虽然我个人比较喜欢 Element 14 的包装设计，但是这两家都在之前的包装的基础上做了很大的改进，跟之前简单的包装（基本上就是一个纯白色的盒子）相比要显得专业的很多。

Opening the box and taking a look at the new board the changes are fairly obvious, and this is even more apparent if you look at the picture to the right comparing the new Model B+ with the old Model B. The most important changes, in my opinion, are the inclusion of a 40 way GPIO header instead of 26 on the Model B, four USB ports instead of two and the change to using a microSD card instead of a full size one. As mentioned above, this change to 4 USB ports is possible due to the change to a new LAN/USB chip (LAN9514). This is the little black chip just behind the USB ports. Further changes include the relocation of the 3.5mm jack, removal of the RCA video output jack (the composite video signal has been relocated to the fourth pole on the 3.5mm jack) and the addition of four squarely positioned mounting holes. The new microSD card holder is now of the push-push type so it is held securely in place (when compared to the friction fit of the old one) and also gives a nice "click" when it is correctly inserted!

打开包装盒看一下新的板子，你会发现跟之前的变化还是很明显的，如果你再看一眼右边的树莓派 B 与 B+ 的对比图的话，这种变化就更显而易见了。在我看来，最重要的变化包括将原来树莓派B上的26个GPIO端口增加到40个，2个USB接口增加到4个USB接口，并且开始改用 microSD 卡而不是之前的那种全尺寸的SD卡。正如前面所提到的，4个USB接口的实现得益于新升级的 LAN/USB 芯片 LAN9514，也就是紧挨着USB接口后面的那个小的黑色的芯片。另外的变化还包括将3.5毫米插孔移到了新的位置，去除了RCA视频输出插孔（复合视频信号已被转移到3.5毫米插孔的第四极）并新添加了四个呈长方形分布的定位安装孔。新的microSD卡插槽是双推式的，所以卡在里面更加安全（相比于旧的摩擦式的），并且当SD卡被正确插好的时候会发出清脆的提示声。

You will probably also notice from the comparison picture that the USB ports no longer hang off the edge as far and are now lined up with the Ethernet port. There has also been a general tidy up of the design and the major ports (excluding the GPIO and DSI connectors) now all lie on just 2 sides of the board. Obviously some of the connectors have had to be shifted around slightly to accomodate this. This should allow for some much neater cabling for home cinema and professional installations where neat installation is very important. For people who like neatness and aesthetics, the round edges on the new PCB are probably also a welcome addition! Looking at the top of the board there are now only two LEDs on the top (power and activity), and they have been relocated to the same side as the DSI port. The Ethernet connection and activity lights are still present but are now located inside the Ethernet jack itself which both looks great and saves space.

从对比图中你也可能已经注意到，USB接口不再超出PCB板子的边缘像被挂在上面一样，而是跟以太网口对齐。新的板子也进行了总体的设计改进，所有的主要接口（除了GPIO和DSI引脚）现在都被安排到了PCB板子的两个边上。为了做到这一点，其他的一些接口也需要稍稍移动位置来做出调整。这样的安排可以实现更整洁的排线，为一些对整洁性要求比较高的家庭影院和专业安装提供了方便。对于那些喜欢整洁和美观的人来说，新的PCB板的圆角边也可能是一个值得高兴的改进！在新PCB板的顶部现在只有两个LED指示灯（电源指示灯和活动指示灯），并且被转移到了跟DSI端口相同的一侧。以太网连接指示灯和活动指示灯也还被保留着，但是被安排在了以太网接口的内部，这样显得美观而且节省空间。

Looking at the comparison of the Model B+ boards from the different suppliers on the previous page, there are some small differences in component selection (see the USB, HDMI , CSI and DSI ports). I am not sure if this is down to the manufacturers sourcing components of their own or whether this is just a coincidence. In either case, the boards are both made in the Sony factory in Wales and look fantastic.

从前面那张不同厂家出产的树莓派B+对比图中可以看出，他们在元件的选择上有一些细微的不同（如USB，HDMI，CSI 和 DSI 接口等）。我不知道这是由于这两家生产商自主采购元件而造成的还是仅仅是某种巧合而已。不过他们两家所用的PCB板都是由在威尔士的索尼工厂生产的，板子看上去好极了。

There are some less noticeable changes "under the hood" with the Model B+ getting an updated power circuit that replaces linear regulators with switched ones in order to reduce power consumption by up to 1 Watt. The audio circuit also now incorporates a dedicated low-noise power supply which should improve the quality somewhat and the USB ports can now be fed with up to 1.2 Amps as well as featuring better overcurrent and hotplug behaviour (plugging and unplugging devices while the Raspberry Pi is running).

还有一些不太明显的变化，树莓派B+升级了电源电路，将线性调节器（linear regulators）替换为交换式调节器（switching regulators），从而达到最高1瓦特的功耗降低。音频电路现在也集成了一个专用的低噪声电源以改善音频质量。USB端口现在可以承载最高1.2安培的电流，也有了更好的电流过载和热拔插性能（树莓派正在运行时插拔设备）。

Getting started

开始上手

Hopefully you, like me, are fortunate enough to use an SD card with the Raspberry Pi that is actually a microSD card in a holder. Personally I use the official SD card with the Raspberry Pi logo silk screened on the holder. This means I did not have to purchase a new SD card in order to get started with the Model B+. However due to the new firmware needed, it is not necessarily quite as easy as just swapping the SD card out of the old Model B and into the Model B+. There are a few steps you may need to undertake first. This is especially important if you have not updated your operating system in a while.

希望你和我一样幸运，之前使用的实际上是一个放在读卡器里面的 microSD 卡。比如我用的就是一个插在读卡器里的 microSD 卡，并在读卡器上标上树莓派的标志。这样你就不用特意为树莓派B+而再去购买一个新的 microSD 卡了。然而，由于新固件的一些需求，你需要做的并不仅仅是简单的将SD卡从老的树莓派B中拔出来然后插到新的树莓派B+上。你可能需要首先做一些准备步骤，特别是如果你已经很长时间没有更新你的操作系统的话，这些准备步骤将变得更加必要。

Open an LX Terminal window and type the following to make sure the software on your SD card is up to date:

Raspberry Pi HATs

树莓派 HATs

With the update to the Model B+, the Raspberry Pi Foundation also recently announced the specification for what they are calling HATs (Hardware Attached on Top). The idea is to have a more regulated framework for add on boards as well as just having a nice name to use for them (similar to Beaglebone Capes and Arduino Shields). The specification outlines a mechanical shape, as can be seen in the picture below, which makes use of the 40 pin header as well as all four of the mounting holes.

在树莓派升级到B+的基础上，官方最近又发布了他们称之为 HATs （Hardware Attached on Top）的规范，其目的是生成一个更加规范的树莓派扩展板开发框架，同时也给这些扩展模块一个好听的名称（就像Beaglebone Capes和Arduino Shields 一样）。该规范定义了一种机械形状（如下图所示），并充分利用了40针的接头，以及所有四个安装定位孔。

All HATs must also have an EEPROM on board which will contain code that allows the Raspberry Pi to automatically identify the add on board and set up the GPIO pins and Linux drivers necessary to get you up and running quickly - which will be extremely useful in schools and clubs with children and beginners.

所有的 HATs 都必须包含一个 EEPROM 模块来存放代码供树莓派用于自动识别该扩展板并配置GPIO引脚和必要的Linux驱动，以便让它能够快速的运行起来 - 这对于那些在学校和俱乐部里的孩子们和初学者来说是非常有用的。
