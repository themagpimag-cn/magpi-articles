Welcome to issue 25,

This month's MagPi contains a wealth of different material. There is a review of Raspberry Pi powered
autopilot technology, the first of a mini-series from the PiBot robotics team, data acquisition with
BitScope and more automation projects. We are also very pleased to host a review of the FishDish
electronics board, written by our youngest guest author so far.

With standard peripherals such as the Raspberry Pi camera, a lot of interesting projects can be
implemented. For example, time lapse photography is introduced this month. The Raspberry Pi,
installed with Linux, provides many network diagnostic tools. Following last month's WiFi sniffing
article, some more networking tips and tricks are discussed.

The MagPi is devoted to providing programming articles without the need for additional hardware. This
month, Java classes are introduced and we are please to provide the first in a series of articles on the
BASIC programming language. Completing this month's programming content, a full Python version of
the Pocket Enigma Cipher machine is given. The Pocket version uses wheels, similar to the original
Enigma machine shown on the cover.

If you have a Raspberry Pi, it would be great to hear how you have used it. We are looking for feedback
or contributions, from young authors to seasoned professionals.
