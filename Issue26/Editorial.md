Welcome to Issue 26 of The MagPi magazine.

This month's MagPi contains another great selection of hardware, software and programming articles.
Michael Giles explains how to turn your Raspberry Pi into a magic wand with a fun hardware project
that demonstrates the persistence of vision effect, while John Mahorney from Suncoast Science Center
in Florida shows how a Raspberry Pi is used to display dynamic art. Big news this month is the launch
of the Model B+ and MagPi writer Aaron Shaw has all the details for you on page 22.

Robotics is always a popular theme and Harry Gee continues on from last month's article and shows
how to add speech, voice control and facial recognition to your robot. Additionally, Rishi Deshpande
describes how to use the SmartDrive controller board to easily control high current motors.

Another popular topic is beer and Sebastian Duell explains his hardware and software "Mashberry"
project which he uses to optimise the mashing process. Karl-Ludwig Butte continues his series on using
a Raspberry Pi and BitScope for electronic measurement plus we have an interesting article by
Walberto Abad on how to set up your own VoIP telephone system.

Last, but definitely not least, Jon Silvera continues his series on learning how to program with FUZE
BASIC. This is an exciting article with lots to discover. I certainly don't remember ever being able to
control sprites this easily with BASIC!

We try to make sure each issue of The MagPi contains something of interest for everyone, regardless of
age and skill level. Have we got the balance right? Let us know by sending an email to
